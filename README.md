# NBA Zone 🏀

NBA Zone is a Spring Boot web application that displays NBA player statistics for the **2024–2025 season**.

The app loads data from `nba_stats_utf8.csv`, exposes it through a backend API, and displays it on a simple frontend.  
Right now, the project runs **locally only** — just start the app and visit it in your browser.
